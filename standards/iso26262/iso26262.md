## Software development
The degree of recommendation to use a particular method below depends on the ASIL (Automotive Safety Integrity Level):
- "++" indicates that the method is highly recommended for the identified ASIL
- "+" indicates that the method is recommended for the identified ASIL
- "o" indicates that the method has no recommendation for or against its usage for the identified ASIL

Prerequisites and output documents for each phase can be viewed in Annex A ISO 26262-6 2011

## Guidelines for ASIL D Software Development
The list below are requirements for ASIL D software design:
  - Dependent failure analysis, FMEA and/or FTA
  - Range check of in/outputs
  - Control flow monitoring + external monitoring
  - Redundancy required
  - Design verification: reviews, simulation, analysis
  - Design rules: MISRA C
  - Static code coverage
  - Code review & Unit testing
  - Requirement testing
  - Fault injection
  - Analysis: function & call coverage

### Phase 1: Initiation of product development at the software level
This is a planning activity where development sub phases and their supporting processes(ISO26262-8, ISO26262-9) are determined. The subphases nd processes are initiated by determining the appropriate methods to comply with the safety requirements and respective ASIL. 

A reference software development phase model is shown below. The specific clauses of each part of ISO 26262 is indicated by m-n where m is the number of the 
part and n is the number of the clause.
![Clauses](clauses.png)

To support the correctness of the deisgn and implementation, the following general modelling and coding guidelines shall be addressed. Specific guidelines shall be different for a specific item development. For example, MISRA C and MISRA AC AGC are coding guidelines for the 'C' language

![Modelling and coding](modelling-and-coding.png)

### Phase 2: Specification of software safety requirements
- Specify software safety requirements - This should address each software function whose failure could lead to the violation of a technical safety requirement
- Detail hardware-software interface requirements initiated in ISO 26262-4:2011, clause 7
- Verify that the above two are consistent with technical safety concept and system design specification

### Phase 3: Software Architectural design
- Develop an architectural design that realizes the software safety requirements - This shall exhibit *modularity*, *encapsulation* and *minimum complexity*.
- Verify this design

Principles for the software architectural design are shown below. An appropriate compromie between the methods can be necessary.
![Software Architectural design](software-architecture-design.png)

The following mechanisms for error detection shall be applied:
![Error detection](error-detection.png)

The following mechanisms for error handling shall be applied:
![Error handling](error-handling.png)

The following methods for architecture verification shall be applied:
![Architecture verification](architecture-verification.png)

Note: For configurable software, recommendations in Annex C in ISO 26262-6 2011 shall be applied. Not sure if this applies to us.

### Phase 4: Software unit design and implementation
- Specify software units in accordance wit the software architectural design
- Implement the software units
- Static verification of the design and implementation of the software units- The design must achieve *avoidance of unnecessary complexity*, *testability* and *maintainability*.


Following are the design principles for the unit design and implementation. Specific guideleines that cover these in detail can be used. For the C language MISRA C covers many of these methods.
![Software unit design](software-unit-design.png)

The following static verification methods shall be used. Dynamic testing will be covered in the next phase.
![Software verification](software-verification.png)

### Phase 5: Software unit testing
Demonstrate that all software units fulfill the design specifications 

The following unit tests shall be applied:
![Unit tests](unit-tests.png)

To evaluate completeness of the test cases, coverage of requirements at the software unit level shall be determined by the following metrics:
![Unit coverage metrics](unit-coverage-metrics.png)

### Phase 6: Software integation and testing
- Integrate the software units
- Demonstrate that te software architectural design in realized by the embedded software

The following integration tests shall be applied:
![Integration tests](integration-tests.png)

To evaluate completeness of the tests, coverage of requirements at the software architecture level shall be determined by the following metrics:
![Integration coverage metrics](integration-coverage-metrics.png)

### Phase 7: Verification of software safety requirements
Demonstrate that the embedded software fulfills the software safety requirements

Tests shall be conducted in the test environments listed below:

- [goanna misra c++ compliance matrix](../misra/misrac++2008-goanna.pdf)

## Tools
In order to be compliant with a standard, one has to use a tool that is certified to be used in the development for that standard. There isn'nt a single tool that will satisfy all clauses of ISO 26262. Any claims on 100% compliance must be examined carefully. Following are the six major areas that have to be covered by tools.

1. Project management - Requirements specification, Requirements verification
2. Design - Software architecture design, software design verification
3. Code - software unit design and implementation, software unit verification

Others:
- Hardware-software integration
- System test
